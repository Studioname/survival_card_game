# survival_card_game
A solitaire survival game where you play a detective tracking a cult

Press spacebar to start
Click on a folder to open it
Player stats are baked into the card options
The stats are:

Investigation
Money
Ammo
Health
Corruption

The suitcase icon enable you to acquire an item

If an icon is highlighted in purple then it is a negative change
If an icon is highlighted in yellow then it is a positive change

You can't get more than 5 of a particular stat
If you go up to 6 of a stat, that sixth point goes towards acquiring an item
Items can be used to restore stats or deal damage to monsters

Corruption increases chance of getting monsters and/or obstacle cards in the deck

Sixth point in corruption does something bad

Player is presented with story cards, they have to pursue the story cards and close out the investigation in order to win

Game not fully functional, but some of it is there

One of my first projects, code unavailable
